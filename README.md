# Surfs Up!
## Overview
For this dataset we will be analyzing the weather to see if a Surf and Shake shop will be successful in this area. For this project we will be using SQLite. 
# Purpose
We have been asked to analyze the weather in this area by W. Avy. The data will be used to determine if the weather trends are going to be favorable for a Surf and Shake shop. We will use SQLite and Jupyter Notebook to create our analyzes. This analysis will be used to look at year-round data in a created Flask app. 
# Results
In our analyses we created the following DataFrames from two typically opposite weather positions throughout the year: June and December. We performed statistical analysis on each month’s temperatures to create the following graph:

   
# Using this comparison we find the following:
•	Using our data we can determine that there were more temperatures accounted for the month of December which may have influence on the statistical statistics between the two months
•	We can see December has a much lower minimum temperature; 56 degrees as opposed to the minimum for June; 64 degrees.
•	We can also see that, surprisingly, June and December have very similar maximum temperatures of 77 and 74 degrees respectively. 
# Summary:
Based on our analysis for the temperatures of June and December we can advise our client that the Surf and Shake ice cream shop should be successful. This location has very similar weather patterns that hint towards a successful year-round ice cream shack. These two queries show that the shop will sell well in this weather at two different points in the year. There can also be additional queries performed to find more information about the weather at other times during the year to predict a positive correlation for sales. We can also look to run analysis on the type of weather, not just the temperature. It might show how precipitation affects the temperature as well. 
# We see the following results for March and September:
   
These months also show a fairly similar trend in temperature, just like the June and December graph. These temperatures should point to a successful future for the Surf and Shake shop. In this data set we see that March has a maximum temperature of 82 degrees with a mean temperature of 71. September shows a maximum temperature of 87 degrees with a mean temperature of 76 degrees. 
# We can run a query on precipitation for both months as shown below:
   
From these queries we can seek to prove that the Surf and Shake will have a productive future in this area as we also see very little precipitation. We see December has a max precipitation of 6.42 but only a mean of .22. In June we see that there is a max precipitation of 4.43 and only a mean of .14 . Overall, this area shows low precipitation and very nice temperatures year-round. This would make an excellent location for an ice cream shack!
